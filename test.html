        <h2> PROFILE AND SKILLS</h2>
        <p>My name is Imelda Labang Donchi Ep Kemezeu. I come from Cameroon.I am 24 years old.I live in UNITED STATES OF
            AMERICA and I am a student at Dallas College.
            Last semester ,I have decided to switch in IT world to achieve my goals,and become a successful WEB
            DEVELOPER.
            FALL 2023,I took some courses like WEB DESIGN TOOLS,INTRODUCTION TO PYTHON AND DIGITAL IMAGING.
            Now, i have some skills in PHOTOSHOP,WEB DESIGN,PYTHON. I also love cooking and dancing and I speak French
            quite
            well than English.
        </p>
        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>
        <h3> MEDICAL BACKGROUND </h3>
        <p>
            I have a diverse skill set and a passion for continuous learning. With a solid foundation in the
            medical field, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. However, my journey doesn't
            stop there. In pursuit of new challenges and opportunities, I have embarked on a journey into the world of
            web
            development.Combining the precision and analytical mindset honed in the medical arena with the creativity
            and
            problem-solving
            skills required in web development, I am carving a unique path. The transition from medicine to web
            development showcases my adaptability and eagerness to embrace change.</p>

        <p>As I navigate the complexities of coding languages, design principles, and development frameworks, I am not
            just
            learning to code but creating a bridge between the healthcare and tech domains. Their
            commitment to growth and versatility is evident in this exciting fusion of two seemingly disparate
            fields.You
            can
            find someone with a rich background, a commitment to lifelong learning, and the ability to
            thrive in diverse and challenging environments. Whether diagnosing medical conditions or troubleshooting
            code, I
            bring a unique perspective and a dedication to excellence.</p>

        <h3> MY PROGRESS IN IT WORLD</h3>
        <p> Last semester I took a web design tools course. In that course,we used the Visual studio code to write our
            html
            code and
            Filezilla to display our page on the server of the school.We used a Git repository for
            our projet files.We also used the W3 validator service,the W3 css-validator and, the wave accessibility
            checker to test and debug the html ,css code and web page.</p>
        <p>We used a W3 css-library and css-style to implement the design of the pages
            (tables,form,color,margin,padding,icons,list...)In this class I have learned how to create a web page, to
            design
            it
            for user-friendly, and some
            other stuff.These will help me to make my first step in the web world. The professor was so explicit and
            availablefor the questions.</p>
        <h3>GOALS</h3>
        <p> I am taking this class(WEB AUTHORING) ,first of all ,because it is one of my courses in the program I have
            choose,and
            also I want to learn more about Virtual Studio Code editor and HTML. I hope we will have a great
            semester.!!!</p>
