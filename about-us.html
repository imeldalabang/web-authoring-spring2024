            <h3 class="gray-txt"> MEDICAL BACKGROUND </h3>
            <p class="dark-txt">
                I have a diverse skill set and a passion for continuous learning. With a solid foundation in the
                medical field, I bring a wealth of knowledge and experience to the table. However, my journey doesn't
                stop there. In pursuit of new challenges and opportunities, I have embarked on a journey into the world
                of
                web
                development.Combining the precision and analytical mindset honed in the medical arena with the
                creativity

                problem-solving
                skills required in web development, I am carving a unique path. The transition from medicine to web
                development showcases my adaptability and eagerness to embrace change.</p>

            <p class="dark-txt">As I navigate the complexities of coding languages, design principles, and development frameworks, I am
                not
                just
                learning to code but creating a bridge between the healthcare and tech domains. Their
                commitment to growth and versatility is evident in this exciting fusion of two seemingly disparate
                fields.You
                can
                find someone with a rich background, a commitment to lifelong learning, and the ability to
                thrive in diverse and challenging environments. Whether diagnosing medical conditions or troubleshooting
                code, I
                bring a unique perspective and a dedication to excellence.</p>
