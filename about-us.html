    <h2 class="fw-bold"> LEARNINGS AND TECHNIQUES </h2>
    <article class="bg-danger-subtle">
      <h3 class="gray-txt">TECHNIQUES</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">In the web authoring class, spring 2024, we used the Visual studio code to write our html code and
        used also
        the W3
        validator service,the W3 css-validator and, the wave accessibility
        checker to test and debug the html ,css code and web page.Using a combination of font family, decorative fonts,
        and font icons can dramatically enhance the visual appeal and functionality of a website. Selecting an
        appropriate font family ensures consistency and readability across different devices and screen sizes, while
        incorporating decorative fonts adds personality and style to headings and other prominent elements.
        Additionally, leveraging font icons through classes enables the integration of scalable vector graphics into
        various parts of the site, enhancing user experience by providing visually appealing and easily recognizable
        symbols for navigation, actions, or highlighting key information. By strategically employing these typographic
        elements, web designers can create engaging and memorable user interfaces that leave a lasting impression on
        visitors.We used a Git repository for
        our projet files.</p>

        <figcaption class="fw-bold"> Capture of Github repository of web authoring class</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We have done box-sizing, flexbox,responsive design,and floated elements on some elements on the site to make the
        site more professional-looking.
        We have used a responsive design ,view meta port meta tag on all pages to make the page responsive on all screen
        devices. We used a CSS3 transitions and transformations and keyframe animations to enhance the design of the
        site.
        We have also created a custom color style sheet by using W3 CSS School,JavaScript HTML DOM to add an click event
        button to change the theme of differents pages.
        The usage of the responsive top nav bar helped us to make the navigation menu professional-looking, by
        collapsing some links when the viewport became different.
        And finally, using Bootstrap library , to design two pages easily just by adding some links and rules to
        elements on the pages.

      <p class="mb-3">
        Bootstrap is a powerful front-end framework that offers a plethora of pre-designed components and utilities to
        streamline the process of building responsive and visually appealing websites. Leveraging Bootstrap, designers
        can quickly create professional-looking pages with minimal effort. The library provides a wide range of
        components such as navigation bars, buttons, cards, forms, and modals, all styled with clean and modern
        aesthetics. Its grid system enables flexible layout structures that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes,
        ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-3">JavaScript continues to be a fundamental tool for achieving various goals in web development and
        beyond.
        Looking to the future, its versatility and widespread adoption make it a crucial language for building dynamic
        and interactive web applications, mobile apps, server-side applications, and even desktop software. With
        advancements in frameworks and libraries like React, Vue.js, and Angular, JavaScript empowers developers to
        create rich user interfaces and immersive experiences that were once only possible with native applications.
        In this class I have learned how to enhance the web page, to design it for user-friendly to make the user feel
        confident , and some other stuff.These will help me to make my second step in the web world. The professor was
        so explicit and available for the questions.

        Learning Bootstrap and JavaScript offers numerous benefits in the current landscape of web development and
        beyond. Firstly, mastering Bootstrap will allow me as a developer to rapidly prototype and build responsive
        websites and
        web applications for clients.Learning these provides developers like me ,with essential skills and tools to
        thrive
        in today's competitive tech landscape, enabling them to create compelling web experiences and unlock countless
        opportunities for growth and innovation.
